## Look at This Companion!

LAT provides targets for direct imaging test using archival data of speckle interferometer (SPOTS, SOAR, WIYN) and spectroscopic binaries (SB9) and more.
The [REACH](http://secondearths.sakura.ne.jp/reach/) project, dedicated for the high-dispersion coronagraphy, uses this code to choose the calibration sources. 

- latsisoar.py Tokovinin+2020 SOAR
- latsitok.py from speckle interferometer (w/ orbital information), Tokovinin+2019.
- latsb9.py from SB9
- latspots.py from SPOTS
- latsiwiyn.py from speckle images by WIYN
- latbyname.py just show elevation...

NO WARRANTY and GOOD LUCK for your observation ;)

### Additional information based on REACH calibration observation

- July 5 (2020) HIP 93935 is a tight binary (sep < 0.1 arcsec) + a companion.
